                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a junior web developer passionate about designing websites but mainly taking on the challenges that come with having to write logical applications. 
                    With 1 year of experience in full-stack development, I specialize in using Javascript language and React as the framework for my projects.</p>
                    <p>I am known for listening to my clients and meeting the expectations that are set for me in bringing an application that will meet their needs.
                    Making an application that is tailored to your personality is what drives me to design websites but I take pride in making an application that will
                    help you in your day-to-day.  
                    </p>
                    <p>I aim to master the field of coding by making all kinds of projects and stepping out of my comfort zone but my real passion in life is to make
                        an impact in the world of Quantam Computing whether that be big or small, only time will tell. For now I plan on making 
                        applications that will make the web a better place for all.
                    </p>
